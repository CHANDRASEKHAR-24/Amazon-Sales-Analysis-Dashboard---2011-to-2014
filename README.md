✅ Key Preprocessing Steps:
- **Extracted customer names** from email addresses  
- **Flagged delivery status** as "On-Time" or "Delayed" using order and delivery dates  
- **Split address data** into: area, city, and state for better geographic insights  

These steps made the dataset more structured and suitable for insightful storytelling via Power BI.

- Analyze **total sales and profit** across time and product categories
