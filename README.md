📊 Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard – 2011 to 2014
Project by: Chandrasekhar H

🚀 First Step – Data Cleaning & Preparation:
As a beginner, my journey began with data extraction, cleaning, and filtering in Excel. I extracted customer names from emails, segregated orders by "On-Time" and "Delayed" delivery using order and delivery date fields, and broke down the address column into area, city, and state for better geographic analysis. These essential preprocessing steps enabled a much clearer, structured dataset, laying a strong foundation for this Power BI dashboard. It also made storytelling easier and insights more actionable.

🎯 Objective
This interactive Power BI dashboard was designed to:

Analyze total sales and profit across time and product categories

Track order volume and state-wise profit distribution

Evaluate category-wise performance toward the ₹1,000,000 sales goal

Enable interactive filtering for detailed, dynamic insights

This interactive flow empowers users to drill down into each product, identify high/low-performing states, and make data-driven decisions for future strategies.

📌 Conclusion & Strategic Insights

Top-selling products (Chairs, Phones) should be prioritized

Profitable regions (California, Washington) offer strong ROI potential

Underperforming states (e.g., Colorado) need strategy revision

Business is 72.5% toward its target, with clear opportunities for optimization

🔧 And it all began with cleaning and structuring the raw data—a crucial step that helped shape a more meaningful, interactive dashboard.
